            <p>&#128533; Hmm, something may not be right with your data. Are you uploading a .csv file specifically from Kajabi?</p>
        {% elif silhouette_score < 0.50 %}
            <p>&#128528; Well, it looks like the model needs some work. But just to be sure, please double-check your data to make sure you have at least 300 entries to ensure statistically significant sampling.</p>
        {% elif silhouette_score < 0.75 %}
            <p>&#128578; Not bad! The model is starting to understand how your customers differ from each other and how to group similar ones together in clusters.</p>
        {% elif silhouette_score < 0.90 %}
            <p>&#129321; Nice! The model is clustering your customers into distinct segments so you can use this information to create better targeted marketing campaigns.</p>
        {% else %}
            <p>&#128562; Wow! This is an AMAZING score. Your customers are clearly defined into distinct groups and segments. But be sure to check your results file because with a score this high, there may be potential for "overfitting", in which case we may need to try a simpler model with a lower number of clusters.</p>
