                <p>&#128561; Oops, it looks like the clustering is really poor. Check your data preprocessing and clustering parameters, as the model might be misclassifying many data points.</p>
            {% elif silhouette_score < 0.25 %}
                <p>&#128533; Hmm, something may not be right with your data. Are you uploading a .csv file specifically from Kajabi? If so, we need to double-check the data preprocessing steps.</p>
            {% elif silhouette_score < 0.50 %}
                <p>&#128528; Well, it looks like the model needs some work. But just to be sure, please double-check your data to make sure you have at least 300 entries to ensure statistically significant sampling. We also may need to try different clustering parameters.</p>
            {% elif silhouette_score < 0.75 %}
                <p>&#128578; Not bad! The model is starting to understand how your customers differ from each other and how to group similar ones together in clusters. Fine-tuning the model may improve results.</p>
            {% elif silhouette_score < 0.90 %}
                <p>&#129321; Nice! The model is clustering your customers into distinct segments so you can use this information to create better targeted marketing campaigns.</p>
            {% else %}
                <p>&#128562; Wow! This is an AMAZING score. Your customers are clearly defined into distinct groups and segments. But be sure to check your results file because with a score this high, there may be potential for "overfitting", in which case we may need to try a simpler model with a lower number of clusters.</p>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>Your downloaded file is an exact duplicate of the one you uploaded, except it has a new column "Segment" appended to the end of your data table. This is your new segmentation data, and has values between 1 and 6.</p>
            <p>
                Explore your data against the "Segment" column to find patterns within your new customer segments, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Which products are popular or frequently used by each segment</li>
                    <li>Which segment has the highest account activity in terms of log-ins</li>
                    <li>Which segment is most likely to buy a specific product if you offered them</li>
                    <li>Which products NOT to offer certain segments to preserve marketing capital</li>
                    <li>Which segment contains users most likely to become a paying subscriber</li>
                    <li>Which segment contains users most likely to churn out (for forecasting purposes)</li>
                    <li>Which segments have low levels of engagement and what you can offer to bring them back</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: This assumes you are familiar with your own Kajabi data and that you are able to do these post-modeling analyses in Excel.</p>
